## Introduction ##
This is a website displaying the portfolio of [Hargunbeer Singh](https://github.com/hamiecod) made primarily using SCSS

## Bugs ##
* In the home page of the mobile version, when you click on the hamburger button and open the hamburger menu quickly again and again, the transition of the hamburger-elements entering from the left side doesn't work properly. When you do the above, you will observe that the `CONTACT ME` and various other elements don't go back into the right side for the next transition. 
* Unable to add grid template columns in the prefix(-ms) for Internet Explorer. In the commented code on line 378 of `dist/css/main.css` is the code for grid template columns in Internet Explorer generated by [Live Sass Compiler](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.live-sass) gives an error while executing the css. 

## Improvements ##
* The project is still in production phase <br>
* Coming soon.. <br>
