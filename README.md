## Introduction ##
This is a website displaying the portfolio of [Hargunbeer Singh](https://github.com/hamiecod) made primarily using SCSS

## Bugs ##
* In the home page of the mobile version, when you click on the hamburger button and open the hamburger menu quickly again and again, the transition of the hamburger-elements entering from the left side doesn't work properly. When you do the above, you will observe that the `CONTACT ME` and various other elements don't go back into the right side for the next transition. 

## Improvements ##
* The project is still in production phase <br>
* Coming soon.. <br>
